Documentation - For updating dashboards

Video instructions on updating files and dashboard can be viewed on this YouTube playlist.
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMJQTeJbJNe-luxgD52eh4TdQM6kgy-NL  

The playlist contains three videos: updating the “MRA Master List.xls” the Tax Revenue file, and the Tableau Dashboard Story. Will likely add or update the videos after sharing them with MRA.

Finding CPI data
To get CPI data, visit - https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm  

1.	Pick All Urban Consumers (Current Series) 
2.	Choose Top Picks, then U.S. city average, All items
3.	Choose the years you want the CPI for
4.	Check the box for  Annual Average 
5.	Once you make those choices click the blue GO button. 
6.	The table should update to download. Click the Download XLSX button to download the table as an Excel file. I used the annual average number.
7.	The annual average can be added to the CPI tab of the Excel file.

To calculate inflation, I used CPI data from the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics, U.S. city average, and All items - CUUR0000SA0 for Years 1978-2022 to help adjust dollar amounts to 2022 dollars. See Figure 28 below.

•	Column A - Year

o	=VLOOKUP(A2:A119,CPI!$A$2:$B$47,2,FALSE)
•	Column E - Tax revenue in 2022 dollars
o	=(CPI Now / CPI Then) * Old value 
o	=(D15/D2)*C2
Finding GPS coordinates Without Python

GPS coordinates can also be found in the URL bar when using Google Maps.
